0. Change the output of pairedTest so it produces both nu statistics
and p-values. Should use the same format as t.test for the output.

1. Separate building the "bank" from evaluating samples against the bank.

2. Add code to do the pilot studies.

3. Split "paired", "bank", and "pilot" into separate source files.

4. Get rid of the nested for loops by vectorizing the code.

5. Figure out what (if anything) from the `inst/DontLose` directory
  should really be kept.

6. Make real examples for the man pages. Decide if these use real or
   simulated data.

7. Write a vignette.
