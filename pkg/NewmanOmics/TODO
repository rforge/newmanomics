1. Add code to do the pilot studies.

2. Create an S4 class for BanedStats objects, and add appropraite grneric functions.

3. Extend the vignette to better illustrate the banked statistic.
   Think about splitting it into two separate vignettes.

4. Write a "summary" method for PairedStats objects.

5. Maybe create a class (with reasonable methods) for the "bank"
   object instead of just using a list.
