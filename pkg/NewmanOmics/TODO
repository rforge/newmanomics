Change the output of pairedTest so it produces both nu statistics
and p-values. Should use the same format as t.test for the output.

1. DONE: KRC: 2017-10-25 1:20 PM
Build test code for running the pairedTest function.

2. DONE: KRC: 2017-10-25 1:30 PM
Get rid of the nested for loops by vectorizing the code.

3. The `pairedStat code is still slow (althoough it passes the
regression test by not changing the test output). We need to profile
it to figure out why it is so slow. I suspect that it's in the random
simulation code. Note that after removing all nested loops, takes
about 90 clock-seconds on my laptop to run the test script.

4. DONE: KRC: 2017-19-25 1:40 PM
Split "paired" and "bank" into separate source files.

5. Figure out what (if anything) from the `inst/DontLose` directory
  should really be kept.

6. Add code to do the pilot studies.

7. Separate building the "bank" from evaluating samples against the bank.

8. Make real examples for the man pages. Decide if these use real or
   simulated data.

9. Write a vignette.
