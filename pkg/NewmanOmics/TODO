1. Figure out what (if anything) from the `inst/DontLose` directory
  should really be kept.

2. Add code to do the pilot studies.

3. Make real examples for the man pages. Decide if these use real or
   simulated data.

4. Write a vignette.

5: Clean up the inst/extdata folder to remove stuff that isn't
absolutely necessary.

6. Decide what to include in the "data" directory. Can possibly move
anything large to the "oompaData" package.
